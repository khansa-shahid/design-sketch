Wireframe Design Overview

In this project, Iâ€™ve created wireframe sketches for my website, paying attention to the layouts for both mobile and desktop views.

Desktop View:

The desktop layout includes a header with logo and navigation menu at the top, followed by the main content area in a two-column format. The left column holds the primary content, while the right column is dedicated to a sidebar with additional links or advertisements.
The footer spans across the bottom, providing useful links and contact details.
Mobile View:

The mobile layout simplifies the desktop design by stacking elements vertically. The navigation is compacted into a hamburger menu, and the sidebar is omitted for a cleaner look. The main content is displayed as a single column to fit within the narrow screen.
These wireframes focus on usability, ensuring that the site will be responsive and functional across devices, while keeping the design simple and intuitive
